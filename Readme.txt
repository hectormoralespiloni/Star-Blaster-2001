STARBLASTER 2001 (Apr-2001)
---------------------------

1. REQUIREMENTS
	-DirectX 6.1+
	-Sound Card
	
2. HOW TO PLAY
	-Arrows => movement (up,down,left,right)
	-Ctrl 	=> fires plasma
	-Space 	=> fires rockets
	-P		=> pauses the game
	-Esc 	=> exits the game  

3. SUMMARY
	This is a 2D shooter scroller demo, game libraries by Andre' Lamothe from 
	his book "Windows Game Programming Gurus"
	The world is at war (as always :P) and we're in the distant year 2001 (well, it was
	distant back in 1995!). Your mission is to stop the invasion of aliens from 
	the outter galaxies. You are equiped with a 2-weapon space craft and the objetive
	is simple, "shoot crap". This demo has 2 levels and 2 bosses and none of my friends could
	even defeat the 2nd boss (give me a break!).
	
4. HOW TO COMPILE
	While you can still run this game using DX 9, compilation is another story;
	I haven't tried to compile this game recently and I'm pretty sure it's going to be
	a little bit difficult because DX has changed so much since version 6. 
	But essentially you only need VC++ (5.0+), DX SDK and the game libraries.
